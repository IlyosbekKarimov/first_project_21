1. Congratulations.
2. *imitation of sarcasm* You're almost done with the first room.
3. To begin with, you must remember that all work should be carried out only on
branch develop! Create it, transferring all the changes there!
4. To open the door, create a new key-branch from develop. Make sure that the key main.key is present in it
5. Create a copy of the key (main-2.key) and commit the changes
6. Create a branch from key-branch and name it feature/3-key
7. Create a second copy of the key (main-3.key) in the feature/3-key branch
8. Commit changes. Don't forget to leave the branch name at the beginning of the commit comment.
> "Don't ask questions why. Programmers always said that this is important: I'm used to it."
9. Add changes from feature/3-key to key-branch
10. Create a release/1.0 branch from the develop branch
II. Submit successively key-branch in develop and develop in release/1.0.
